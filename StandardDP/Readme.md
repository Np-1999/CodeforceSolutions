<h1 id="dynamic-programming">Dynamic Programming</h1>
<p>Steps to reach a solution using dynamic programming</p>
<ul>
<li>Look For recursive solution</li>
<li>Recursive solution will help you to find mathematical formula for memoization.</li>
<li>Look for number of changing variables in recursive call that will give you an idea about memoization as well as time complexity.</li>
<li>Using recursive function form iterative function. Please follow recursive function as much you can.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems for next time:</p>
<ul>
<li>Traveling Salesman problem</li>
<li>Least number of modification to make string palindrome.</li>
<li>More on strings</li>
</ul>
